The advatages of an unordered container are
  - using hashing,which gives better average case performance in principle
  - having no cost of maintaining elements in order
  - finding elements at const time.
The advatages of an ordered container are  
  - all keys beging sorted alphabetically
  - easier to use(no need to find a effective hashing)
