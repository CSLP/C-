r and q points to the same memory,while the old memory by r is leaked ,since no pointer points to it and it is not freed.  
First,the reference count of r2 is decreased,and the memory pointeed by r2 is freed,since no shared\_ptr points to it.Second r2 and q2 point th the same memory,and the reference count of both smart pointers are increased.
